# Project-2
Project 2 Repo
The World Happiness which ranks ~155 countries by their happiness levels, is released at the United Nations every year.
The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations.
The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and shows how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.
With this project we hope to present a user interactive application with multiple visualizations to understand how the world happiness is measured.
