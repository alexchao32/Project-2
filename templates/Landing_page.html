         Did you know countries are ranked each year based on a Happiness Index? This index rates the happiness of countries on a scale from 0 to 10, and it's pretty fascinating!

         Happiness Index? It's an indexation of happiness based on survey results, that was first used in the 2012 World Happiness Report. In the survey, the respondents were asked to rate their happiness on a scale from 0 to 10. The Happiness Index is calculated by averaging the survey results of the respondents.

         The World Happiness Report sources its data from the Gallup World Poll.


         The key variables of the Happiness Index & the questions based on which the results were derived
         1. GDP per capita
         This is arguably the most accepted method of determining a country's level of wealth. And as most of you know, a country's wealth is highly correlated to its happiness.
         2. Social support
         Survey question:
          ""If you were in trouble, do you have relatives or friends you can count on to help you whenever you need them, or not?"
         3. Healthy life expectancy
         The estimate for the healthy life expectancy represents the average number of "healthy" years a child at birth is estimated to live. It's calculated by the WHO based on over 100 different health factors.
         4. Freedom to make life choices
         Survey question:
         "Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what you do with your life?"
         5. Generosity
         Survey question: "Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?"

         6. Perceptions of corruption: It is calculated by averaging the answers to the following 2 questions:
         "Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not?"

         "Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?"
